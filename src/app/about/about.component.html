<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
  Our goal here at Where's My Truck is to provide the most up to date
  and accurate representation of the food trucks that are out there 
  every day. We prepopulate daily off of listed schedules, then rely on
  crowd sourcing to remove trucks that are not in their listed location
  or to add trucks not in the schedule.
